# Delete-Shortcuts
Simple program to delete shortcuts from the specified directory.

Works using C#'s built in Directory and File classes. Has a fair bit of input validation but isn't perfect. Mainly made to 
1.) Get some practice in and 
2.) Get semi-familiar with Github.

Uses Colorful.Console (https://github.com/tomakita/Colorful.Console) for the gradient of the logo. I originally used it for many different aspects of the text, but it kept on giving me issues so I dropped the amount that I used it significantly. It doesn't change anything about the way that Console. already works, simply adds new functionality.
